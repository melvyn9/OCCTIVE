Basics of Programming,basics-of-computational-problem-solving-and-programming,Basics of Computational Problem Solving and Programming,"Learn how solving problems with code begins by understanding the task, designing a step-by-step solution, and translating that into a working program. Discover how this process often involves cycles of testing and fixing errors to refine and improve the final result.",,1,"https://youtu.be/gZjZ52jE1rI, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K7jis3vADk"
Setting Context,setting-context,Setting Context,"Explore how computers use numbers to represent and process information like images, sound, and text to solve real-world problems. Learn why understanding core computing concepts such as sequencing, decision-making, and iteration helps build a strong foundation for programming and problem-solving across different languages and fields.",,2,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LozdbWhe5-E, https://youtu.be/8_3XBp7p4HQ"
Naming and Assignment,naming-and-assignment,Naming and Assignment,"Learn how variables are used to store and manage information in a program through assignment statements and clear naming. Explore how different data types, calculations, and output statements help organize, manipulate, and present values. Practice writing and running simple programs in R and Python while learning how to test and debug your code step by step.",,3,"https://youtu.be/E8wQu0gj8AQ, https://youtu.be/vR1f4856fP8, https://youtu.be/wT0AloUYIac, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M_1pbSr_o8, https://youtu.be/8cDkz_f7nzk, https://youtu.be/ebgiKHgv_xk, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU2ipHTPOlo"
Functions,functions,Functions,"Learn how functions help organize and simplify code by grouping instructions that can be reused across different parts of a program. Understand how to call built-in and custom functions in Python and R using variables, expressions, and different argument types. Explore how to define your own functions to receive input, return output, and improve the flexibility and clarity of your code.",,4,"https://youtu.be/izartze3mZw, https://youtu.be/8ja0Pz8CJ5o, https://youtu.be/XHjD4OKzbUs, https://youtu.be/EJPIPWC8gm0, https://youtu.be/H2MJGme0OxE, https://youtu.be/WtuiF1T0sXg"
Data,sequences-and-data-frames,Sequences and Data Frames,"Learn how sequences and data frames store and manage structured data in memory for efficient access and manipulation. Understand how to use indexing and conditional selection to retrieve or modify elements, rows, and columns in both R and Python. Explore how data frames differ from files on disk and how they serve as powerful tools for data analysis within a program.",,5,"https://youtu.be/AM26uLNwP8A, https://youtu.be/FJJUc0E8zTs, https://youtu.be/YsVvI8O8b3E, https://youtu.be/oZDEJH3W6EM"
Troubleshooting,troubleshooting,Troubleshooting,"Learn how to approach programming challenges by developing strategies for understanding documentation and troubleshooting errors. Understand how to interpret function references and fix common mistakes like syntax, runtime, and logic errors. Strengthen your problem-solving skills by learning how to test and refine your code with confidence.",,6,"https://youtu.be/IXerdgKCJDM, https://youtu.be/paqS5Qyd4Jk"
