          This video library is intended primarily for use in non-CS courses that use

          within their fields of study. In this new project we are improving the existing

          concepts.

        <p>
          This project aims to serve the national interest by preparing students in
          non-computing majors to use computational techniques in their academic
          work and future careers. Increasingly, students in all disciplines must
          learn to use computing technology. To meet the increased need for students
          to use computational methods across all fields, non-computing courses
          commonly integrate computational components into their curricula. However,
          many non-computing faculty are not prepared to teach the computing
          concepts that underlie the computational techniques that their students
          must master. This project will support non-computing faculty who are
          teaching computing concepts by developing a curated set of videos that
          provides the content needed for students to learn basic computing
          concepts. The infusion of foundational computing concepts into
          non-computing courses will increase both the number and diversity of
          students who are prepared to utilize computational technologies when they
          enter the workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project&rsquo;s goals are to (1) expand and strengthen the OCCTIVE
          video library (Online Computing-Concepts Toolkit of Interdisciplinary
          Videos for Education), designed to introduce foundational computing
          concepts in non-CS courses, (2) broadly disseminate OCCTIVE for use by
          non-CS faculty and peer tutors, and (3) assess the impact of OCCTIVE use
          on students, faculty, and peer tutors. The expansion and improvement of
          the OCCTIVE library will be informed by best practices in instructional
          video design. The videos will be supplemented with sample teaching
          material and other support materials that aid faculty adoption. Faculty,
          who will be recruited from a wide range of disciplines and institutions,
          will be trained to integrate OCCTIVE into their courses through in person
          and virtual workshops. The efficacy of the OCCTIVE library will be
          measured by assessing students&rsquo; comprehension of computing concepts,
          faculty&rsquo;s adoption of materials in their classes, and peer tutor
          experiences. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development
          projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.
          Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the
          creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and
          tools.
